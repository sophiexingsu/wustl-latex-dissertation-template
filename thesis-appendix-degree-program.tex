\label{app:degree-program}
\textbf{What to Call your Degree Program on your Title Page and your Abstract Page.}

\section{Title page}
The second line (or second and third lines) on the page must name your \emph{administrative unit}.

\begin{itemize}
\zerotrivseps   % eliminate the vertical space introduced by center environment
\item If your degree is offered by one department of Arts \& Sciences on the Danforth Campus, your unit is that department:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Department of East Asian Languages \& Cultures}
    \end{center}

\item For a co-sponsored degree such as English \& Comparative Literature, credit both:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Department of English}\\
        \emph{Program in Comparative Literature}
    \end{center}

\item For the Division of Biology \& Biomedical Sciences, credit DBBS and your program:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Division of Biology \& Biomedical Sciences}\\
        \emph{Neurosciences}
    \end{center}

\item Credit only the program for any of the non-DBBS PhDs on the Medical Campus:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Interdisciplinary Program in Movement Science}\\
        or\\
        \emph{Program in Speech \& Hearing Sciences}
    \end{center}

\pagebreak
\item If you are in a department in Engineering, credit the School and the department:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{School of Engineering \& Applied Science}\\
        \emph{Department of Biomedical Engineering}
    \end{center}

\item If you are in social work or business, your administrative unit is the School:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Brown School of Social Work}\\
        or\\
        \emph{Olin Business School}
    \end{center}

\section{Abstract page}
Frequent confusion occurs because your abstract heading names your degree rather than your administrative unit, so it may – or may not – match your title page in that respect.

\begin{itemize}
\zerotrivseps   % eliminate the vertical space introduced by center environment

\item For the Division of Biology \& Biomedical Sciences:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Doctor of Philosophy in Biology and Biomedical Sciences}\\
        \emph{Neurosciences}
    \end{center}

\item For a co-sponsored degree such as English \& Comparative Literature, credit both:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Doctor of Philosophy in English and Comparative Literature}
    \end{center}

\item If you are in a department in Engineering, credit the School and the department:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{School of Engineering \& Applied Science}\\
        \emph{Department of Biomedical Engineering}
    \end{center}

\item If your degree is offered by one department of Arts \& Sciences on the Danforth Campus:
    \begin{center}
        \emph{Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry}
    \end{center}
